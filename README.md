5. Once installed, you can activate FocusIt using the provided keyboard shortcut or by executing the command from the Command Palette.

## Usage

1. Activate the FocusIt extension by using the default keyboard shortcut (you can customize this in your settings) or by executing the "Focus It" command from the Command Palette.
2. All other open windows will be hidden, leaving only the currently focused window visible.
3. To restore all previously hidden windows, activate the FocusIt extension again.
